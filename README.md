My name is Sithabile Mananga and I am a self-taught, passionate junior fullstack developer with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and the react ecosystem. I am currently seeking opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to a team of experienced professionals. As a junior developer, I am constantly striving to improve my skills and expand my knowledge in the field.

- 🌱 I am currently learning about state management with Redux and am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
